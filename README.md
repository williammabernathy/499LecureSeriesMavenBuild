# Java Sorting App

This project was an assignment given to as during our CSC 499 Career Preperation class.
It's purpose is to practice the basics of what we may deal with in a work environment

Included is the source code, files worked with, and the organized files needed. 
The only needed file to run the program is the file:
 	- "Command Line Sorting Program"
All necessary files are located here

## To run

1. Place the contents of "Command Line Sorting Program" or the folder itself onto your desktop or in a memoriable place that has no restricted actions.
2. Open a command prompt or equivalent
3. Navigate to the directory in which you've placed "WilliamAbernathyCSC499Homework1.jar" and "Sort Me.txt"
4. Enter: 
```java
java -jar "WilliamAbernathyCSC499Homework1.jar"
```
5. Follow the prompt.


## Troubleshooting

Ensure that the file "Sort Me.txt" is placed in the same directory as "WilliamAbernathyCSC499Homework1.jar".

Ensure java is up to date.

Ensure the folder has editing permissions

Ensure you are in the correct directory when running the .jar
	
- For example C:\Users\matth\Desktop\Command Line Sorting Program

## To test

!NOTE: Sorted Names.txt must be present, meaning the application must have ran at least once in order to build the Sorted Names file

!NOTE: If testing for ascending order, must run the file at least once and sort by ascending for test to run correctly, and vice versa if testing for descending order.

1. Open the Project source code with Netbeans or similar IDE
2. Navigate to the "test" file
3. Right click on CompareTestAscending.java or CompareTestDescending.java
4. Click "Run File"
5. Examine the results; either success or fail.
